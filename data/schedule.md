# BEE 4750 Fall 2026 — Semester Plan

Planning document. **Canonical** for the plan; `schedule.qmd` is the student-facing rendering.

> ⚠️ `schedule.qmd` currently carries a **superseded seven-quiz numbering** and needs reconciling
> against the six-quiz plan below.
>
> ⚠️ `data/schedule.csv` is stale — referenced nowhere, disagrees with `schedule.qmd` on weeks 1–7,
> and from row 14 is contaminated with a different course entirely (Bootstrap, Missing Data, GLMs,
> Spring Break, March–May dates). Delete or archive it.

**Class**: MW 2:55–4:10pm (75 min), 105 Riley-Robb.
**No class**: Sep 7 (Labor Day), Oct 12 (Fall Break), Nov 25 (Thanksgiving).
**Last class** Dec 7 assumed; project presentations Tue Dec 8 sit in the final-exam slot and do not
consume a class day. Confirm all three break dates and the last day against the registrar.

## Session plan — Sep 16 onward

Status key: **Ready** — deck exists and is revised for FA26 · **Revise** — source exists, needs the

| 16 | Mon Dec 7 | Course Wrap-Up and Synthesis | *flex* | **New** | **Quiz 6** |

**Totals from Sep 16**: 24 rows — 2 no-class days and **22 sessions**, of which 6 are ready, 3 reuse
as-is, 8 need revision, 1 new build is drafted (the peer-review activity), and 3 are new builds still to do (DP, Lab 3, and the wrap-up —
model validation turned out to be a port, not a new build). The simulation half ends Oct 7; optimization runs Oct 14 – Dec 7. Instructor away
weeks 10 and 12 (Oct 26/28, Nov 9/11) — each gets one TA-supervised lab or a procedural lecture, and
no quiz falls in either.

---

## Quizzes

Six total, one dropped for 4750. Rules observed: a quiz never covers material from its own week,
labs are never assessed, and no quiz falls in a travel week or on Thanksgiving week. Host sessions
were chosen so the 25-minute loss lands on an activity session or a reuse deck — never on
from-scratch or already-compressed material.

| Quiz | Date | Gap | Covers | Host absorbs it? |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|:--|
| 1 | Wed Sep 9 | — | — | — |
| 2 | Mon Oct 5 | 26 d | Discretization, convergence, Streeter-Phelps, and all of Monte Carlo (foundations, confidence intervals, sample size, risk) | Plume analytics — rebuilt Oct 2 around the regulator's questions; about 15 content slides after the quiz |
| 3 | Wed Oct 21 | 16 d | Both plume sessions and model validation. **Stops short of week 8**, leaving LP to anchor Quiz 4 | Peer review — activity session |
| 4 | Wed Nov 4 | 14 d | LP, shadow prices, economic dispatch (including multi-period and ramping) | MIP — reuse deck |
| 5 | Mon Nov 16 | 12 d | Capacity expansion, MIP, waste/networks, unit commitment | Stochastic optimization — reuse deck |
| 6 | Mon Dec 7 | 21 d | Scenario trees, DP, sensitivity/robustness/MOO, limits of optimization | Wrap-up session |

**Quiz 2 moved to Mon Oct 5** (decided Sep 25) so students have worked on HW4 (released Sep 30) over a weekend before it, and so it can cover all of Monte Carlo; Sep 30 keeps its full session and finishes Monte Carlo with the risk section. This breaks the 12–21-day spacing (26 days after Quiz 1, 16 before Quiz 3).

**Oct 19 and Oct 21 swapped** (decided Sep 26): duality moves to Monday, straight after the Oct 14 LP lecture, and the proposal peer review with Quiz 3 moves to Wednesday, giving two working days to distribute the Oct 16 proposals. The written peer review moves to Mon Oct 26, clear of the Oct 22 MP1 and HW6 deadlines.

Spacing otherwise runs 12–21 days. The two 21-day gaps sit at the ends: Quiz 2 waits for enough material to
accumulate, and Quiz 6 spans Thanksgiving. Coverage balances at 3/4/3/4/4 sessions.

### Question bank

Reusable questions live in `exams/midterm1` and `exams/midterm2`, across branches:
`git show Fall25:midterm1.qmd`, `git show b956d06:midterm2.qmd` (FA24), `git show Fall23:midterm1.qmd`.

- **Quiz 2** — the airshed Monte Carlo questions recur across FA23/24/25: exceedance probability,
  "should you stop sampling?", what 10,000 samples buys, CI interpretation (3–4 min each). Euler
  discretization of a given ODE also appears repeatedly. Well supplied.
- **Quiz 3** — plumes and validation have **no exam precedent**; both need writing.
- **Quiz 4** — the best-supported quiz. Graphical LP appears on 4/4 optimization-era exams (~8–10 min);
  the "without calculating the objective, which points could be optimal? justify each" variant is the
  strongest single item found. LP true/false (~5 min). The farmer shadow-price set is reused every
  year: units, which constraints bind, relaxation comparison, buy-the-land arithmetic (2–5 min each).
  Dispatch formulation from a plant table (~12–15 min) plus "where does the price come from" (3 min).
  The duck-curve conceptual question (FA25, 2 pts) moves here now that ramping is taught Oct 28.
  More precedented material than will fit — pick two.
- **Quiz 5** — **no precedent at all** now that the duck-curve item has moved to Quiz 4. Capacity
  expansion, MIP, branch and bound, network/waste allocation, and unit commitment have never been
  assessed on a timed exam here. Draft early and time-test. Unit commitment is the most promising
  new source: "which constraints need a binary, and why" is a clean 4–5 minute item.
- **Quiz 6** — Pareto non-dominance has precedent (FA23: identify non-dominated policies from a
  4×3 reservoir table, ~5–8 min), pairing with an objective-vs-metric conceptual part. Scenario-tree
  and DP questions need writing.
- ⚠️ **Do not reuse the full YUK formulate-a-model question** — at 16–25 points it consumed ~35 minutes
  of a 75-minute exam. "Decision variables with units and bounds" alone is a clean ~10-minute item.

## Homework and mini-projects

Weekly cadence; every homework pairs a by-hand component with a *light* computational one. Anything
needing scale — many effluents, real data, full capacity expansion — goes to a mini-project. Due
Thursdays 9pm. Nine homeworks total, inside the syllabus's 8–10, one dropped.

| HW | Assign | Due | Topic | By-hand | Computational (light) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 4 | Wed Sep 30 | Thu Oct 8 | Monte Carlo, uncertainty & risk | Expectation/variance of a function of a random variable; why MC error scales as σ/√n and the samples a target precision needs; exceedance probability and return periods; aleatory vs. epistemic | Propagate parameter uncertainty through the HW3 model; CI on one decision-relevant quantity plus an *n*-convergence plot |
| 5 | Wed Oct 7 | Thu Oct 15 | Gaussian plumes & model validation | Evaluate the plume equation at a receptor; stability class and wind speed effects; where the max ground-level concentration occurs; what a goodness-of-fit metric is blind to | Evaluate the plume on a coarse grid, locate the max, and score it against observations |
| 6 | Wed Oct 14 | Thu Oct 22 | Decision models & linear programming | Formulate from a word problem: decision variables with units and bounds, objective, constraints; standard form; solve a 2-variable LP graphically | None required |
| 7 | Wed Oct 21 | Thu Oct 29 | Duality, shadow prices & first JuMP | Identify binding constraints; interpret shadow prices with units; decide whether to buy capacity given a shadow price; what a zero shadow price implies | Solve the *same* LP in JuMP, extract duals, confirm they match the hand answer |
| 8 | Wed Nov 4 | Thu Nov 12 | Mixed integer programming | Model a fixed cost, an either/or, and an indicator with binaries; why the LP relaxation bounds; trace 2–3 branch-and-bound nodes | Solve a small MIP; compare to its LP relaxation |
| 9 | Mon Nov 9 | Thu Nov 19 | Network models & waste allocation | Set up a small facility-allocation network; flow-conservation and capacity constraints; siting indicators | Solve the instance; interpret which facilities open |

**Design notes.** HW4 deliberately echoes HW3, putting deterministic truncation error in Δt beside
statistical error in *n*. HW6's graphical-LP question should match Quiz 4's format so the homework is
real practice. HW7 asks for the hand answer *before* the JuMP check. Weeks 13–16 carry no new
homework — the term project fills them: update (Nov 13), presentations (Dec 8), report (Dec 20).

**Two mini-projects, not three** (decided Sep 23), each worth 10% and scoped to a short report so it reads as a project rather than a heavier homework. MP1 runs four weeks because Fall Break and the proposal fall inside it; MP2 runs three, opening with the dispatch lecture it depends on. MP3 is dropped; Lab 3 stands on its own.

| MP | Assign | Due | Topic |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Wed Sep 23 | Thu Oct 22 | **Simulating DO with multiple effluents** — three effluents and a tapered sludge bed; justify the spatial step, check four candidate treatment plans against the standard, propagate an uncertain load by Monte Carlo, and recommend a plan. Adds the sludge bed's share of the problem and one-step treatment upgrades. Four weeks at a 4-page report scope, so it runs lighter per week than a homework |
| 2 | Wed Oct 28 | Thu Nov 19 | **Electricity dispatch with a carbon tax** — multi-period economic dispatch of an existing fleet (NYISO-style demand and wind/solar capacity factors, ramping limits), hourly prices from the demand-constraint duals, and a carbon-tax sweep to find where coal and gas switch. Final part (after the Nov 2 lecture): add build decisions, impose a CO₂ cap, and show a tax at the cap's shadow price gives the same result. Pure LP. Reuses the FA25 `hw/hw04` data |

## Build inventory

**New from scratch**
- ~~**Model validation** lecture (Oct 7)~~ — **written**. It was never a from-scratch build: the FA25 deck `lecture05-1-dissolved-oxygen-2.qmd` carries a full calibration-and-validation section (Oreskes framing, RMSE, nonuniqueness, positive and negative controls, empirical vs. face validity) that had not been ported forward.
- **Sequential decisions & dynamic programming** lecture (Nov 18) — no deck exists
- **Lab 3**, scenario trees + sequential decisions / reservoir operations (Nov 23)
- Quiz questions for plumes, validation, MIP, networks, scenario trees, DP — none have exam precedent
- **Every homework from HW4 on**, and both mini-projects (MP1 is drafted in `mini-project/mp01`; MP2 does not exist yet)

**Major revision**
- Split `lecture09-1-capacity-expansion.qmd`: shadow-price half + JuMP intro → Oct 21; capacity half
  merges with `lecture10-1-capacity-expansion-2.qmd` → Nov 2. This is what puts prices before the
  applications.
- Split `lecture13-2-limits-optimization.qmd` (filename says limits, title says Multiple Objectives,
  it holds both): MOO half → Nov 30; limits half → Dec 2, absorbing gradient-descent material from
  `lecture15-2-simulation-optimization.qmd`.
- ~~Recompose Nov 11 from the renewables/duck-curve parts of `lecture10-2`~~ — dropped. That split
  existed only to lighten Oct 28 for a substitute. The substitute is a power systems expert, so
  Oct 28 keeps its multi-period and renewables material and Nov 11 becomes unit commitment instead.
- Nov 30 three-way merge (sensitivity + robustness + MOO) is the most over-subscribed session: keep
  the conceptual thread, push formal Morris/Sobol' to a reading.
- Compress `lecture07-1-prescriptive-modeling` + `lecture08-2-optimization` into Oct 14.

**Reuse** — Monte Carlo (both), both plume decks, economic dispatch, MIP, waste/networks, stochastic
optimization, `lab03` as Lab 2.

**Dropped** — simulation-optimization as its own session. (Unit commitment is **no longer dropped**:
it returns as the Nov 11 session.)

## Open items and risks

1. **`schedule.qmd` is out of sync** — it carries seven quizzes with the old numbering.
2. **Lab repo numbering is crossed.** Splitting Monte Carlo across two lectures removed the MC lab,
   so the JuMP lab becomes Lab 2 and scenario trees becomes Lab 3 — but `labs/lab02` *is* the Monte
   Carlo lab and `labs/lab03` is the JuMP one. Renumber the repos or accept display numbering that
   differs from repo names.
3. ~~Stale plume deck dates and filename prefixes~~ — fixed: dates now Sep 30 and Oct 5, files renamed to `lecture06-2-plume-derivation` and `lecture07-1-plume-analytics`. Note `lecture07-1-prescriptive-modeling` now shares the `lecture07-1` prefix; that resolves when it merges into the Oct 14 session.
4. **`lecturexx-xx-lake-uncertainty.qmd`** ("Parameter Uncertainty in the Shallow Lake Model") has no
   lecture number, no date, and no slot. Shelve deliberately or place it.
5. **Assignment authoring is the largest build item of the term** — larger than the slide revisions.
   Sequence it against the assign dates above, not against lecture prep.
6. **Two travel weeks, four covered sessions.** Oct 28 and Nov 11 go to a power systems expert and
   need no simplification — both can be full lectures. **Nov 9 (waste and network models) is not a
   power systems topic**; it still needs a plan. No re-sync time on return — budget a few minutes at
   the top of Nov 2 and Nov 16.
7. **Almost no slack.** Contingency: fold the reservoir application into Lab 3 and compress the DP
   lecture. Nov 11 is no longer the first thing to cut — it now carries the MIP application.
8. **Stale fork**: `slides/lecture10-1-gaussian-plumes.qmd` duplicates the first half of
   `lecture10-1-capacity-expansion-2.qmd`. Resolve before editing either — the Nov 2 recomposition
   touches that material.
9. **Deck filenames encode FA25 lecture numbers** that no longer match; the `lecture09-1` split turns
   one file into two sessions two weeks apart.
10. **`project/index.qmd` links `update.qmd`, which does not exist.**
11. Syllabus promises 27 lectures; this calendar yields 28.
